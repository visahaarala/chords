#### DRY: Typescript types and arrays with same values

Is there a way to get array of values from a type? Other way around it will not work because then the type cannot be used to describe the values. For example [beats.ts](https://github.com/visahaarala/jazzchords/blob/main/src/data/beats.ts) is sort of repeating what is already written in [index.d.ts](https://github.com/visahaarala/jazzchords/blob/main/src/%40types/index.d.ts).
