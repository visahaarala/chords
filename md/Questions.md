#### DRY: Typescript types and arrays with same values

Is there a way to get array of values from a type? Other way around it will not work because then the type cannot be used to describe the values. For example:

- beats.ts is sort of repeating what is already written in index.d.ts

- Notes.tsx is sort of repeating index.d.ts
