# TO-DO list

## now

#### PWA installation instructions

- iPhone DONE
- TODO: android etc.

## later

#### make chord playable

Elementary Audio

#### whiteKeyIndex

Use of that term whiteKeyIndex is not coherent throughout the app. Sometimes it means the index of the array ['C', 'D', 'E', ...], and sometimes it means the index of whitekeys in the whole keyboard. And where is the zero value, at middle C. Have to clarify this at some point.

#### randomTop note octaveNumber

.. fix randomizing.

- Calculate octave not when creating the note but when displaying?
- If octave not set, calculate a new randomTop and update Chord details?
- If clef/range changed, reset all randomnote information?
- Min range set to a 7th instead of an octave?

#### other

- klikkipallot on/off

- roman numerals

- random bass eg. C7/E

## ideas/comments from friends

#### basic

- remove double flats & sharps

- change things enharmonically when the option is a natural note

- ability to hear the chords / base note

- more explanation / instructions (locs, settings, etc)

- metronome and practice tempo difference confusing

- why is there a separate metronome in the program

- player settings into a separate tab?

- possibility to hear chords / bottom note

#### more complex

- creating accompaniment notation based on chords (vapaas√§estys)

- reading music from thesession.org and generating accompaniment
