# TO-DO list

#### now

- make button/select sizes coherent (settings select can be smaller)

- fix disabled (playbuttons) style to use program colors instead of contrast filter

- player settings within same tab as player

- use `mobile` mixin to stubstitute for `@media (pointer: coarse) and (orientation: landscape) { ... }`, used in so many places

- random top note

- check click visuals with actual mouse (touchpad touch gestures do not tell the whole truth)

#### later

- make chord playable

- fix scrolling.. now looks different in different parts of program

- browser agnostic [PWA install button](https://plainenglish.io/blog/create-a-browser-agnostic-pwa-install-button), or just browser-specific instructions.

- klikkipallot on/off

- roman numerals

- random bass eg. C7/E
