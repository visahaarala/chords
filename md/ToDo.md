# TO-DO list

#### now

- why are locks not showing on iPhone?.. not showing on safari either

#### later

- Bass clef toggle

- make chord playable

- metronome UI might not be so godd.. Maybe a range slider that works as a nudge tool, starting from center.. further right/left means faster changes? .. have to figure out something new! something to do with PointerEvent

- accidentals.. first slot read notes from top to bottom, second slot from bottom to top, third slot top to bottom, etc.. result more pleasing to the eye

- progressive app installation info dropdown (detect os, be specific), pure CSS??

- browser agnostic [PWA install button](https://plainenglish.io/blog/create-a-browser-agnostic-pwa-install-button), or just browser-specific instructions ??

- check click visuals with actual mouse (touchpad touch gestures do not tell the whole truth)

- use `mobile` mixin to stubstitute for `@media (pointer: coarse) and (orientation: landscape) { ... }`, used in so many places

- klikkipallot on/off

- roman numerals

- random bass eg. C7/E
