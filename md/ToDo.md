# TO-DO list

... instead of creating generating chord objects, I should create a (randomized) list of keys and a list of extensions.


#### now

- change absolute randomness to systematically (randomly) going through each key/chord before repeating any of them

- add heart symbols (on/off) on both sides of the main chord - for repeating that particular key / chord extension more often.

#### later

- random top note

- roman numerals

- random bass eg. C7/E
