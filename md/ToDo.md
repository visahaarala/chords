# TO-DO list

#### now

- change absolute randomness to systematically (randomly) going through each key/chord before repeating any of them

- change chord symbols from Arial to custom made SVGs, to make them look exactly the same in every OS

#### later

- random top note

- roman numerals

- random bass eg. C7/E
