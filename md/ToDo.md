# TO-DO list

#### now

- change absolute randomness to systematically (randomly) going through each key/chord before repeating any of them

- add heart symbols (on/off) on both sides of the main chord - for repeating a given key / chord extension more often.

#### later

- random top note

- roman numerals

- random bass eg. C7/E
