# TO-DO list

#### now

- Divide random keys/extensions to two pools. Go through one at a time and mix the pool in between. 

- add heart symbols (on/off) on both sides of the main chord - for repeating that particular key / chord extension more often.

#### later

- random top note

- roman numerals

- random bass eg. C7/E
