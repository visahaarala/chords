# TO-DO list

## now

### Octave naming

Bass & treble clef. Middle C is `C4`. Bass clef C in the middle of staff is `C3`. Just to be logical with octave naming and random top note range choosing for each clef.

## later

### progressive app installation

info dropdown (detect OS, be specific), pure CSS??

browser agnostic [PWA install button](https://plainenglish.io/blog/create-a-browser-agnostic-pwa-install-button), or just browser-specific instructions ??

### metronome UI

..might not be so good.. Maybe a range slider that works as a nudge tool, starting from center.. further right/left means faster changes? .. have to figure out something new! something to do with PointerEvent

### make chord playable

Elementary Audio

### click visuals 

check with actual mouse (touchpad touch gestures do not tell the whole truth)

## update README.MD

... before publishing, check the texts are up to date

### other

- klikkipallot on/off

- roman numerals

- random bass eg. C7/E
