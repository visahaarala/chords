# Issues

- The chord symbol layout does not work in Firefox.

- `play` functionality seems to not work on some older iPhone iOS versions due to problems with AudioContext.

- Using tab to navigate on a desktop browser seems to work only partially in Safari.

- `wakeLock` is used to prevent display from sleeping when playing through chords. However, it seems to work only on newer desktop browsers (excluding Firefox). On mobile devices, display sleep should be prevented manually from the device settings.
