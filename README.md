Simple tool for practicing random jazz chords.

Generate and go back and forth between chords using the `Next` & `Previous` buttons, or automatically `Play` through different chords using metronome settings under `Tempo`.

Designed for portrait mobile phone, but also nice on desktop. Use TAB forÂ handy navigation on desktop while practicing an instrument (unless you're using Safari).
