# Jazz chords trainer

[https://jazzchords.vercel.app](https://jazzchords.vercel.app)

A simple tool for practicing random jazz chords.

Set the range of sharps & flats under `Accidentals` and the chord complexity level under `Difficulty`.

Generate and go back and forth between chords using the `Next` & `Previous` buttons, or automatically `Play` through different chords using metronome settings under `Tempo`.

Designed for portrait mobile phone, but also nice on desktop. On desktop, use (`shift`-) `tab`, `space`, `esc` and `arrow` keys for navigation while playing an instrument (unless you're using Safari).

`play` button does not work on iPhone iOS ver. 16.x because of problems with audioContext.
