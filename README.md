Simple tool for practicing random jazz chords.

Set the range of sharps/flats under `Accidentals` and the chord complexity level under `Difficulty`.

Generate and go back and forth between chords using the `Next` & `Previous` buttons, or automatically `Play` through different chords using metronome settings under `Tempo`.
