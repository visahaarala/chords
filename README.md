# jazzchords

[https://jazzchords.vercel.app](https://jazzchords.vercel.app)

A tool for practicing random jazz chords.

This program is a Progressive Web App. It can be installed on the home screen of mobile devices (Android, iOS).

Designed primarily for a right-handed user of a mobile phone (iPhone XS as a reference). Works both portrait & landscape.

On desktop, navigate with (`shift`-)`tab`, `space`, `esc` and `arrow` keys while playing an instrument.

Tested desktop browsers (on Mac Os X): Chrome, Safari, Opera and Firefox. Chrome and Opera seem to work the best. Firefox has problems with chord layout. Safari has problems with `tab` navigation.

Written with React, Typescript & SCSS using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev).
